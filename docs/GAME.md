# The game: Sydney on Foot and Melbourne on Foot

The city model becomes a place you can be in. In Sydney you walk the centre as
a surveyor, talk to the people who know it, climb the Opera House steps, catch
the ferry, and fly a helicopter under the Harbour Bridge. In Melbourne you check
the winter sun on Federation Square, take a river shuttle down the Yarra, and
fly past the Arts Centre spire. The world is the same open-data model as the
viewer. In Sydney that means:

- 7,962 buildings from OpenStreetMap;
- the NSW bare-earth terrain;
- the real sun in Sydney's time zone.

Everything the characters tell you about the city is computed from the model
while you play.

Open it from the globe (**Play** on a city card), from the 3D model (the
**Play** chip), or directly at `web/index.html#play-sydney` or `#play-melbourne`.

| Ferry | <kbd>F</kbd> skip ahead, <kbd>H</kbd> take the helm for the approach to the next wharf |

On a phone you get a joystick and buttons. Camera moves (the start, fast travel, a
survey) end at once on any key or drag.

The survey comes in lines. After a welcome, three surveys run side by side, in
any order, and a report back waits for all three. The Sydney survey has seven
stamps:
- **Welcome** (Ava, at Circular Quay): she sets out the three surveys and asks
  which you want to start with.
- **The harbour** (Marco, at the Opera House), two stamps:
  - hear how the shells are cut from one sphere, and climb the Monumental Steps;
  - ride the ferry to Milsons Point, then walk up the bridge approach to the
    middle of the arch.
- **The air** (Sam, at the Kirribilli helipad): fly under the deck and land in the
  Domain.
- **The ground** (Priya, in Martin Place), two stamps:
  - find a spot that gets sun at lunchtime on the winter solstice;
  - then, with Tom, use the survey lens on three buildings whose heights come from
    different sources.
- **Report back** (Ava): opens once the three surveys are done.

A step counts whether its line is tracked or not. If you stand in the sun in Martin
Place on the way to the ferry, the ground survey moves on. <kbd>T</kbd>, or a tap
on a survey's name in the quest card, chooses the line that the route, the beam and
the minimap's star follow. The other lines show as hollow stars.

Docking a ferry by hand earns an extra stamp. After the survey, the city is free
roam, with two things to do in it at any time:

- **Trig stations.** Five survey points round the harbour, each a △ on the map: the
  bridge at mid-arch, Observatory Hill, Barangaroo Reserve, Mrs Macquarie's Chair and
  the Opera House steps. At one, <kbd>E</kbd> turns you once round on the spot. The
  camera turns with you, and the buildings in sight are named with their heights and
  sources. Your field notes then give:
  - how many buildings are in sight within 3 km;
  - the tallest of them, and where its height comes from;
  - how the heights in sight were measured.

  Surveying all five earns the Trig master stamp.
- **Height challenge.** Aim at a building, press <kbd>G</kbd>, and guess its height.
  The answer comes with the data's own error: a floor-count height is good to about
  ±20% nine times in ten, and an estimate to much less. A guess inside that range is
  as good as the data, and the score says so.

The Melbourne survey has the same shape and six stamps:
- **Welcome** (Mia, at Federation Square).
- **The square** (Hannah, in City Square): how DDO10 protects public spaces from
  new shadow, and a sunny spot on Federation Square at lunchtime on 22 June.
- **The river** (Arjun, at Federation Wharf), two stamps:
  - the river shuttle to Crown Landing;
  - Sophie's helicopter past the Arts Centre spire to Birrarung Marr.
- **The heights** (Jun, in Birrarung Marr): the survey lens on three height
  sources.
- **Report back** (Mia).

Melbourne has no ferry through the city, so the shuttle is invented and says
so.

The menu (<kbd>Esc</kbd>) lets you play as either surveyor.

**Photo mode** (<kbd>O</kbd>, or **Photo** on a phone) stops the world: the
people, the traffic and the ferries hold still, and the HUD goes. You control the
camera and the shot:
- **Camera:** drag to turn round the focus and scroll to come closer. <kbd>W A S D</kbd>
  and <kbd>Space</kbd>/<kbd>C</kbd> move the focus up to 300 m from you.
- **Time:** moves the sun for the picture, and the clock stays there when you leave.
- **Lens:** the field of view, shown as a full-frame focal length.
- **Extras:** Turntable circles slowly, Grid shows the thirds, and Show me hides
  your surveyor.

**Save photo** (<kbd>Enter</kbd>) writes a PNG. Its caption gives the place, the
date and time, the sun's height and the data credit.

## What we took from other games, and where this one is different

A research pass looked at the games people compare this to. The sources are
listed at the end.

| Game | What we took | What this does that it can't |
|---|---|---|
| **Microsoft Flight Simulator** | Hand-built landmarks over generated filler; an assisted helicopter, since players find hovering hard. | Its buildings are generated, and it shipped errors that open data can contain. A two-storey building tagged as 212 floors in OpenStreetMap reached the sim as a Melbourne monolith. Sydney's Harbour Bridge was a flat auto-generated span until World Update VII. Here every height has a source, outliers are capped, the towers are checked against published heights, and the bridge is built to its published geometry. |
| **Sketchbook** (three.js sandbox) | Assisted helicopter flight: the rotor cancels gravity so it hovers with no input, levels itself, damps drift and spools up before take-off. You walk to the door instead of teleporting in, and <kbd>E</kbd> to use. | Its world is an empty sandbox. Here the world is a real city with things to do. |
| **GTA V** | A clock running 30 times real time, so a day lasts 48 minutes. A minimap with a GPS route along the street network. A waypoint you click on the map. A crowd and traffic density setting. Skip-the-trip travel. | Its city is a caricature. Here the streets, wharves and sun are real, the traffic drives on the left at Overture speed limits, and crowds keep left as Australians do. |
| **Ship Simulator Extremes** | Docking as the skill moment: the ferry runs on autopilot across open water, then you bring her alongside and are scored. | Reviewers found its long cruises boring. Here the open-water legs can be skipped, and docking is optional. |
| **Assassin's Creed Discovery Tour** | Guided learning by place: each stop is a person who explains what is in front of you, with "behind the data" honesty. | Its narration was called dry. Here the lines are short and come from the model, such as the share of Martin Place in sun on 21 June at 12:30, computed while you stand there. |
| **A Short Hike, Animal Crossing** | One-breath dialogue lines that you can finish with a tap, a voice beep pitched per character, and small tasks with small rewards (passport stamps). | Their worlds are invented. Here a favour is a fact about a real place. |
| **Assassin's Creed viewpoints** | Climb to a high point, and the camera turns once round you while the names fill in. | Its viewpoints reveal what designers placed there. Here what is named is what is in sight from that spot: a line of sight through the model to each roof, with the source of each height. |
| **GTA V character switch** | The fast-travel camera goes up, across the city and down onto the player, instead of cutting. | Its sky camera hides streaming. Here it keeps the city in one piece, and the cruise height clears the tallest roof on the route. |
| **GeoGuessr** | A guess scored against the answer. | Here the answer has error bars and the score shows them. For an estimated height, a good eye can be as good as the data. |
| **Breath of the Wild** | After a short prologue, the main quests open together and can be done in any order. | Its quests end in invented places. Here each line ends in a fact about a real one. A step from one line completes while you follow another, because both are a position, a time or a sun angle in the same model. |
| **Ghost of Tsushima photo mode** | The world holds still, and you change the time of day and the lens. | Its light is art-directed. Here the sun for the time you choose is the computed one, and the saved picture's caption says when and how high it was. |
| **Bruno Simon's portfolio, slowroads, Streets GL** | Instanced crowds, cars and street furniture. Detail only near the player. A hint to lower the density when the frame rate drops. | Streets GL needs a discrete GPU. This runs on a phone, with lower density there. |

## How it works

All of this is driven by `cities/<id>/city.json` (`game` block) and the files the
pipeline writes. The only city-specific code is landmark geometry in
`cities/<id>/city.py`:
- Sydney's bridge, Opera House and steps;
- Melbourne's spire.

- **Game data** (`pipeline/game_data.py` writes `web/data/<city>/game.json`):
  - **Water mask:** 5 m.
  - **Walking terrain:** 5 m. It drops at the seawall instead of sloping across
    a 10 m cell.
  - **Footways and roads:** 3D polylines.
    - Bridge parts follow the deck surface, using Overture's `is_bridge` flags
      and levels.
    - Tunnel parts are dropped (`is_tunnel`).
  - **Ferry berths:** placed next to the Overture ferry terminals named in the
    config.
  - **Ferry routes:**
    - Found by a shortest path through open water, weighted to keep to the
      middle of the channel and away from piers.
    - Smoothed only as far as the route still stays at least 4 m from land.
  - **Benches and street lamps:** from OpenStreetMap.
  - **NPCs:** snapped to open ground.
- **Opera House steps** (`city.py`): the Monumental Steps are 90 m wide and run
  40 m from the forecourt to the podium, as measured on the NSW aerial photo.
  They climb in two flights of 15 cm risers, with a landing between them and
  one at the top. A short ramp at the foot meets the forecourt, where the 5 m
  terrain dips up to 2 m into the vehicle concourse entrance. They are a walkable strip whose profile follows every riser,
  so feet land on the treads. Footways that cross them are draped onto them,
  so the crowd uses them too. The risers are a darker granite, so the steps
  read from a distance.
- **Bridge deck** (`city.py`):
  - The deck runs level across the arch and pylons.
  - The approach viaducts then descend at 5% until they meet the ground, the
    way the real approaches continue to the Cahill Expressway and North Sydney.
  - People and cars use the same surface, so you can walk across with the
    traffic.
- **Navigation** (`web/game/nav.js`): the 2 m surface model (terrain plus
  buildings, with building ids) does three jobs:
  - walls;
  - low roofs you can step onto;
  - the sun meter.

  Piers are 2.2 m decks, and the bridge deck is a walkable strip. The landmark
  meshes are rasterised as height intervals, so the helicopter can pass under
  the deck but not through the arch.
- **People** (`web/game/people.js`, assets from `pipeline/fetch_people.py`):
  - **Characters:** 13 rigged characters from Quaternius's Ultimate Modular Men
    and Women packs (CC0): office workers, a suit, a hoodie, beachwear,
    hikers, hi-vis workers. They have realistic proportions and 5,000–10,000
    triangles each.
  - **One draw call each:** the pipeline merges each character into one skinned
    mesh. Every vertex indexes a small palette, so skin, hair and clothes are
    recoloured per person, and 13 files make a varied crowd.
  - **Animation:** walk, jog, idle and wave clips. Their playback speed is
    matched to the ground speed, measured from how fast the planted foot slides
    in each clip, so feet don't skate. NPCs turn their heads to look at you and
    wave when you talk to them, and passers-by wave back when greeted.
  - **Near and far:** the 14 nearest passers-by (6 on a phone) are fully
    skinned. Everyone further away is an instanced copy of the same character,
    simplified by vertex clustering. Its legs, knees and arms swing in the
    vertex shader, and the shadows move with them. That is one draw call per
    character for hundreds of people.
- **Traffic** (`web/game/actors.js`):
  - **Pedestrians and cars:** both spawn within about 450 m of the player.
  - **Cars:** brake for the cars ahead and for the player.
  - **Headlights:** come on after sunset.
- **Vehicles** (`web/game/vehicles.js`), built from `web/game/kit.js`. The
  kit has lofted hulls, lathes, slabs, fins, rods and tubes at real
  dimensions, merged into one mesh per material. It is adapted from the vessel
  kit of an earlier reef scene, with classic materials so the city's lights and
  shadows fall on it.
  - **Helicopter:** a light scenic type. It has a bubble cabin with its glass,
    an engine deck, a tail boom with a fin and stabiliser, skids, and a rotor
    that blurs into a disc at speed. It flies the assisted model, with
    collisions against buildings and landmark solids.
  - **Ferries:** double-ended, like Sydney's, so they reverse without turning.
    The size and livery come from the city's `ferry_style`: Sydney Ferries'
    green and cream with a gold band, and an invented navy shuttle on the Yarra.
    Each one has:
    - a lofted hull with antifouling, a boot stripe and a sheer band;
    - a rubbing strake;
    - a windowed saloon;
    - an upper deck with rails, benches and lifebuoys;
    - a wheelhouse at each end;
    - a mast and flag;
    - navigation and deck lights that come on after dark.

    Each ferry slows into its wharf and waits. You can take the helm into a
    wharf by hand.
- **Water:** the same `web/water.js` sea as the model viewer. The waves follow
  the city's wind, the shore foam follows the kind of shore, and the city
  shows in the water. The ground gets a wet band at the waterline.
- **Sun and time:**
  - **Clock:** the game starts at Sydney's actual time. If it's dark there, the
    title screen offers 9 am first.
  - **Sun meter:** ray-casts from where you stand four times a second through
    the same surface model the sun-access analysis uses. The Opera House shells
    and the bridge deck are added so they shade you too.
- **Ground** (`web/game/game.js`): close up, the 1 m aerial photo is blurred
  and has the photo's own shadows baked in. Near the player, the ground blends
  into streets drawn from the footway and road data at 0.5 m per pixel, with
  kerbs and centre lines, so the real-time shadows read correctly.
- **HUD** (`web/game/hud.js`):
  - **Minimap:** drawn once from the data, with the heading up.
  - **GPS route:** Dijkstra over the footway and road graph.
  - **Dialogue:** typewriter text.
  - **Stamps:** saved in the browser.
- **Camera shots** (`web/cine.js`, shared with the model viewer):
  - **How they work:** a shot maps progress (0 to 1) to a camera pose. The director
    plays one at a time on the game clock. A key or a drag skips it, and a skipped
    shot still does what it was for (a skipped fast travel still moves you). With
    reduced motion, every shot is a cut.
  - **Start:** from the title orbit, the camera closes in over the player at height,
    drops down beside them and swings in behind. It ends exactly on the chase camera,
    and you can walk while it moves.
  - **Fast travel:** the camera rises over the player and crosses the city. It cruises
    110 m above the tallest roof on the route, read from the surface model's 16 m block
    maxima. It comes down behind the player, who faces the way they flew.
  - **Trig stations:** one turn on the spot, over the player's shoulder with a longer
    lens. The names are the result of a line of sight through the 2 m surface model to
    just under each roof within 3 km. The surface model includes the Opera House
    shells and the bridge deck.
  - **Buildings:** no shot puts the camera inside one. Each pose is kept 3 m above the
    surface model under it.
- **Sound** (`web/game/audio.js`): synthesised with Web Audio, with no files.
  - harbour ambience;
  - footsteps on the walk cycle;
  - rotor chop at the blade-pass rate;
  - ferry engine and horn;
  - dialogue beeps.

## Testing

The game exposes a test hook (`window.__game.advance(seconds, keys)`) that runs
the simulation at a fixed 30 Hz without rendering. A Playwright script plays
the whole survey this way. It checks:

1. Walking moves you along the ground.
2. You can't walk into buildings or the harbour.
3. Each quest step completes:
   - **Ferry:** the right ferry is offered at the wharf, waiting can be
     skipped, you board, the ride arrives at Milsons Point, and you get off.
   - **Bridge:** you walk 650 m up the north approach to mid-arch, on the deck
     surface.
   - **Helicopter:** it takes off, flies under the deck (the crossing event
     fires), and lands in the Domain.
   - **Sun:** with the time set to 21 June at 12:30, a sunlit spot in Martin
     Place completes the step.
   - **Survey lens:** it finds a surveyed, a floor-count and an estimated
     height.
4. All seven stamps are awarded.

The camera shots were checked the same way:
- the start: it lands on the chase camera;
- a fast-travel hop: the player arrives, and also arrives when the hop is skipped
  with a key;
- a survey at the bridge and at Observatory Hill: the right buildings are named, and
  the field notes are written;
- the height challenge: the guess is scored against the band of the height's source.

A Melbourne script plays its six stamps the same way: the sun step at
Federation Square on 22 June, the river shuttle to Crown Landing, and the
flight to Birrarung Marr. A further script docks a ferry by hand. Phone layout, the routes into the game
and the menus are checked in a phone-sized browser.

## Limitations

- **Close-up ground:** at street level the aerial imagery is still the weak
  point. The drawn streets help on paths and roads. Plazas and courtyards that
  OpenStreetMap maps only as areas still show the photo.
- **People:** the characters are low-poly, with simple faces, and there are 13
  base bodies. Distant walkers swing rigid legs and arms instead of playing the
  full animation. The box-built figures return if the character files cannot
  be loaded.
- **No physics engine:** collisions use the surface model, which is 2 m. There
  is no ragdoll or car damage, and pedestrians don't avoid each other.
- **Ferry timetable:** the routes follow the inner-harbour services, but the
  timetable is invented. Ferries run at 1.5 times real speed.
- **Vessels on the water:** a ferry rides the mean water level and does not
  pitch or roll on the waves. Its wake is a fan of foam drawn on the water, not
  waves of its own.
- **Interiors:** buildings are extrusions with no interiors. Roofs are flat,
  except where OpenStreetMap maps building parts.
- **Lines of sight:** trees are not in the surface model, so a building behind a
  tree still counts as in sight. Each building is sighted at one point, just under the
  roof of its tallest part.
- **The edge of the model:** the last few hundred metres fade into haze, so the city
  does not end in a cliff over a flat sea. The haze hides the edge; it does not fill
  it. There is nothing of the city beyond the frame, and the wharves and streets
  near the frame look hazy from a distance.
