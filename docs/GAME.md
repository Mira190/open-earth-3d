# The game: Sydney on Foot and Melbourne on Foot

The city model becomes a place you can be in. In Sydney you walk the centre as
a surveyor, talk to the people who know it, climb the Opera House steps, catch
the ferry, and fly a helicopter under the Harbour Bridge. In Melbourne you check
the winter sun on Federation Square, take a river shuttle down the Yarra, and
fly past the Arts Centre spire. The world is the same open-data model as the
viewer. In Sydney that means:

- 7,962 buildings from OpenStreetMap;
- the NSW bare-earth terrain;
- the real sun in Sydney's time zone.

Everything the characters tell you about the city is computed from the model
while you play.

Open it from the globe (**Play** on a city card), from the 3D model (the
**Play** chip), or directly at `web/index.html#play-sydney` or `#play-melbourne`.

| Ferry | <kbd>F</kbd> skip ahead, <kbd>H</kbd> take the helm for the approach to the next wharf |

On a phone you get a joystick and buttons.

The Sydney survey has seven stamps:
1. Get your bearings at Circular Quay.
2. Hear how the Opera House shells are cut from one sphere, and climb the
   Monumental Steps to the podium.
3. Ride the ferry to Milsons Point.
4. Walk up the bridge approach to the middle of the arch.
5. Fly under the deck and land in the Domain.
6. Find a spot in Martin Place that gets sun at lunchtime on the winter solstice.
7. Use the survey lens on three buildings whose heights come from different sources.

Docking a ferry by hand earns an extra stamp. After the survey, the city is
free roam.

The Melbourne survey has six:
1. Meet Mia at Federation Square.
2. Hear from Hannah in City Square how DDO10 protects public spaces from new
   shadow.
3. Find a sunny spot on Federation Square at lunchtime on 22 June.
4. Take the river shuttle from Federation Wharf to Crown Landing.
5. Fly from the Yarra helipad past the Arts Centre spire to Birrarung Marr.
6. Use the survey lens on three height sources.

Melbourne has no ferry through the city, so the shuttle is invented and says
so.

The menu (<kbd>Esc</kbd>) lets you play as either surveyor.

## What we took from other games, and where this one is different

A research pass looked at the games people compare this to. The sources are
listed at the end.

| Game | What we took | What this does that it can't |
|---|---|---|
| **Microsoft Flight Simulator** | Hand-built landmarks over generated filler; an assisted helicopter, since players find hovering hard. | Its buildings are generated, and it shipped errors that open data can contain. A two-storey building tagged as 212 floors in OpenStreetMap reached the sim as a Melbourne monolith. Sydney's Harbour Bridge was a flat auto-generated span until World Update VII. Here every height has a source, outliers are capped, the towers are checked against published heights, and the bridge is built to its published geometry. |
| **Sketchbook** (three.js sandbox) | Assisted helicopter flight: the rotor cancels gravity so it hovers with no input, levels itself, damps drift and spools up before take-off. You walk to the door instead of teleporting in, and <kbd>E</kbd> to use. | Its world is an empty sandbox. Here the world is a real city with things to do. |
| **GTA V** | A clock running 30 times real time, so a day lasts 48 minutes. A minimap with a GPS route along the street network. A waypoint you click on the map. A crowd and traffic density setting. Skip-the-trip travel. | Its city is a caricature. Here the streets, wharves and sun are real, the traffic drives on the left at Overture speed limits, and crowds keep left as Australians do. |
| **Ship Simulator Extremes** | Docking as the skill moment: the ferry runs on autopilot across open water, then you bring her alongside and are scored. | Reviewers found its long cruises boring. Here the open-water legs can be skipped, and docking is optional. |
| **Assassin's Creed Discovery Tour** | Guided learning by place: each stop is a person who explains what is in front of you, with "behind the data" honesty. | Its narration was called dry. Here the lines are short and come from the model, such as the share of Martin Place in sun on 21 June at 12:30, computed while you stand there. |
| **A Short Hike, Animal Crossing** | One-breath dialogue lines that you can finish with a tap, a voice beep pitched per character, and small tasks with small rewards (passport stamps). | Their worlds are invented. Here a favour is a fact about a real place. |
| **Bruno Simon's portfolio, slowroads, Streets GL** | Instanced crowds, cars and street furniture. Detail only near the player. A hint to lower the density when the frame rate drops. | Streets GL needs a discrete GPU. This runs on a phone, with lower density there. |
| **GTA V's scenario points, The Sims, Unreal's Smart Objects and Detour Crowd** | Benches as places to sit. Each has two seats that a passer-by claims, walks to, sits on and leaves, and each advertises what it offers. Walkers look a few seconds ahead and step aside for each other and for you. | Their people pick seats by script or by invented needs. Here they pick by the sun the model computes. At 12:30 on the winter solstice every sitter around Martin Place is on a sunny bench, though only 55% of the benches there are in sun. On a January afternoon, 92% of the benches are in sun but only 21% of the sitters. |
| **Unreal Engine** | The CharacterMovementComponent's capsule sweep: slide along a wall, stop in a corner, push out of anything you start inside, step up what is low enough. The SpringArm's probe sphere for the camera. Re-written from the documentation, since the engine's code can't be copied into an open project. | Its collision is whatever the level designer built. Here it is the published footprints, so walking into a wall tests the open data. [docs/ENGINES.md](ENGINES.md) is the full study of what else to take from Unreal and other engines. |

## How it works

All of this is driven by `cities/<id>/city.json` (`game` block) and the files the
pipeline writes. The only city-specific code is landmark geometry in
`cities/<id>/city.py`:
- Sydney's bridge, Opera House and steps;
- Melbourne's spire.

- **Game data** (`pipeline/game_data.py` writes `web/data/<city>/game.json`):
  - **Water mask:** 5 m.
  - **Walking terrain:** 5 m. It drops at the seawall instead of sloping across
    a 10 m cell.
  - **Footways and roads:** 3D polylines.
    - Bridge parts follow the deck surface, using Overture's `is_bridge` flags
      and levels.
    - Tunnel parts are dropped (`is_tunnel`).
  - **Ferry berths:** placed next to the Overture ferry terminals named in the
    config.
  - **Ferry routes:**
    - Found by a shortest path through open water, weighted to keep to the
      middle of the channel and away from piers.
    - Smoothed only as far as the route still stays at least 4 m from land.
  - **Benches and street lamps:** from OpenStreetMap.
  - **NPCs:** snapped to open ground.
- **Opera House steps** (`city.py`): the Monumental Steps are 90 m wide and run
  40 m from the forecourt to the podium, as measured on the NSW aerial photo.
  They climb in two flights of 15 cm risers, with a landing between them and
  one at the top. A short ramp at the foot meets the forecourt, where the 5 m
  terrain dips up to 2 m into the vehicle concourse entrance. They are a walkable strip whose profile follows every riser,
  so feet land on the treads. Footways that cross them are draped onto them,
  so the crowd uses them too. The risers are a darker granite, so the steps
  read from a distance.
- **Bridge deck** (`city.py`):
  - The deck runs level across the arch and pylons.
  - The approach viaducts then descend at 5% until they meet the ground, the
    way the real approaches continue to the Cahill Expressway and North Sydney.
  - People and cars use the same surface, so you can walk across with the
    traffic.
- **Navigation** (`web/game/nav.js`):
  - **Grids:** the 2 m surface model (terrain plus buildings, with building ids)
    runs the sun meter and the survey lens. The 5 m water mask keeps walkers out
    of the water.
  - **Piers and decks:** piers are 2.2 m decks, and the bridge deck is a
    walkable strip.
  - **Landmarks:** the landmark meshes are rasterised as height intervals in 2 m
    cells, so the helicopter can pass under the deck but not through the arch.
- **Collision** (`web/game/collision.js`): every building solid is a prism, its
  published footprint between two heights, and each landmark cell is a box.
  - **Walking:** the walker is a 0.35 m capsule, moved the way Unreal's
    CharacterMovementComponent moves one:
    - it is swept against the walls between knee and head;
    - it slides along what it hits and stops in a corner;
    - it is pushed out if it starts inside;
    - anything lower than a 0.75 m step is left to the floor, which also comes
      from the exact footprints.
  - **Camera:** a 0.25 m probe sphere is swept from the player to the camera
    against walls, roofs and soffits, as Unreal's SpringArm does.
  - **Measured against the old 2 m grid:** 120 walks into walls at random
    angles ended inside a footprint 50 times before and never now. The closest
    approach is now the capsule radius. See
    [ENGINES.md](ENGINES.md#1-movement-and-collision-built).
- **People** (`web/game/people.js`, assets from `pipeline/fetch_people.py`):
  - **Characters:** 13 rigged characters from Quaternius's Ultimate Modular Men
    and Women packs (CC0): office workers, a suit, a hoodie, beachwear,
    hikers, hi-vis workers. They have realistic proportions and 5,000–10,000
    triangles each.
  - **One draw call each:** the pipeline merges each character into one skinned
    mesh. Every vertex indexes a small palette, so skin, hair and clothes are
    recoloured per person, and 13 files make a varied crowd.
  - **Animation:** walk, jog, idle and wave clips. Their playback speed is
    matched to the ground speed, measured from how fast the planted foot slides
    in each clip, so feet don't skate. NPCs turn their heads to look at you and
    wave when you talk to them, and passers-by wave back when greeted.
  - **Sitting:** there is no clip for it.
    - The legs are bent over the idle pose: each thigh is aimed forward and
      each shin straight down.
    - The feet are IK targets in these rigs, so they are moved to the ends of
      the shins, and the body is lowered until they touch the ground.
    - The far copies bend their legs the same way in the vertex shader.
  - **Near and far:** the 14 nearest passers-by (6 on a phone) are fully
    skinned. Everyone further away is an instanced copy of the same character,
    simplified by vertex clustering. Its legs, knees and arms swing in the
    vertex shader, and the shadows move with them. That is one draw call per
    character for hundreds of people.
- **Crowd** (`web/game/actors.js`):
  - **Walking:** pedestrians follow the footways, keeping left.
  - **Stepping aside:** each walker looks four seconds ahead for anyone it will
    pass closer than 0.6 m, the player included.
    - It steps aside within the footway's width, choosing the side by where the
      other person is now. If both judged by where the other will be, each
      would mirror the other's sidestep, and they would cross into each other.
    - If it can't get round, it slows to the other person's pace.
    - This is RVO and Detour Crowd confined to the footway.
    - With 40 walkers on one footway, pairs walked through each other 2.8
      times a tick before, and never now. People used to freeze when you stood
      among them; now they walk round you.
  - **Benches:** the benches are smart objects.
    - 1,375 of Sydney's 1,862 benches and 891 of Melbourne's 1,181 can be
      reached from a footway in a straight line that is clear of walls, water
      and steps.
    - Each faces its footway, or turns round to face the water when there is
      water behind it. Each has a backrest and two seats.
    - A walker passing a bench with a free seat may claim the seat, walk over,
      sit for 25 to 75 seconds and walk on.
  - **Sun or shade:** the game re-tests the benches near you against the sun,
    about 60 a second, with the same ray cast as the sun meter.
    - Whether people want the sun depends on the city's average daily top for
      the month, against a comfortable 22 °C. That is the `climate` block in
      `game.json`, from the Bureau of Meteorology.
    - People lean towards the sun when it is low.
    - Greet someone on a bench and they tell you when the sun reaches it or
      leaves it today.

    Around Martin Place:

    | Time | Benches in sun | Sitters in sun |
    |---|---|---|
    | 21 June, 12:30 | 55% | 100% |
    | 15 January, 14:00 | 92% | 21% |
- **Traffic** (`web/game/actors.js`):
  - **Pedestrians and cars:** both spawn within about 450 m of the player.
  - **Cars:** brake for the cars ahead and for the player.
  - **Headlights:** come on after sunset.
- **Vehicles** (`web/game/vehicles.js`):
  - **Helicopter:** the assisted model, with collisions against buildings and
    landmark solids. It slides along a wall it meets at a glancing angle and
    bounces off a hard hit.
  - **Ferries:** double-ended, like Sydney's, so they reverse without turning.
    Each slows into its wharf and waits. You can take the helm into a wharf by
    hand.
- **Sun and time:**
  - **Clock:** the game starts at Sydney's actual time. If it's dark there, the
    title screen offers 9 am first.
  - **Sun meter:** ray-casts from where you stand four times a second through
    the same surface model the sun-access analysis uses. The Opera House shells
    and the bridge deck are added so they shade you too.
- **Ground** (`web/game/game.js`): close up, the 1 m aerial photo is blurred
  and has the photo's own shadows baked in. Near the player, the ground blends
  into streets drawn from the footway and road data at 0.5 m per pixel, with
  kerbs and centre lines, so the real-time shadows read correctly.
- **HUD** (`web/game/hud.js`):
  - **Minimap:** drawn once from the data, with the heading up.
  - **GPS route:** Dijkstra over the footway and road graph.
  - **Dialogue:** typewriter text.
  - **Stamps:** saved in the browser.
- **Sound** (`web/game/audio.js`): synthesised with Web Audio, with no files.
  - harbour ambience;
  - footsteps on the walk cycle;
  - rotor chop at the blade-pass rate;
  - ferry engine and horn;
  - dialogue beeps.

## Testing

The game exposes a test hook (`window.__game.advance(seconds, keys)`) that runs
the simulation at a fixed 30 Hz without rendering. A Playwright script plays
the whole survey this way. It checks:

1. Walking moves you along the ground.
2. You can't walk into buildings or the harbour.
3. Each quest step completes:
   - **Ferry:** the right ferry is offered at the wharf, waiting can be
     skipped, you board, the ride arrives at Milsons Point, and you get off.
   - **Bridge:** you walk 650 m up the north approach to mid-arch, on the deck
     surface.
   - **Helicopter:** it takes off, flies under the deck (the crossing event
     fires), and lands in the Domain.
   - **Sun:** with the time set to 21 June at 12:30, a sunlit spot in Martin
     Place completes the step.
   - **Survey lens:** it finds a surveyed, a floor-count and an estimated
     height.
4. All seven stamps are awarded.

A Melbourne script plays its six stamps the same way: the sun step at
Federation Square on 22 June, the river shuttle to Crown Landing, and the
flight to Birrarung Marr. A further script docks a ferry by hand. Phone layout, the routes into the game
and the menus are checked in a phone-sized browser.

## Limitations

- **Close-up ground:** at street level the aerial imagery is still the weak
  point. The drawn streets help on paths and roads. Plazas and courtyards that
  OpenStreetMap maps only as areas still show the photo.
- **People:** the characters are low-poly, with simple faces, and there are 13
  base bodies. Distant walkers swing rigid legs and arms instead of playing the
  full animation. The box-built figures return if the character files cannot
  be loaded.
- **No rigid-body physics:** walls are exact, but the landmarks (the Opera
  House shells, the bridge steel) still collide as 2 m boxes. The floor is found
  under the walker's centre, not under the whole capsule. There is no ragdoll or
  car damage. [ENGINES.md](ENGINES.md#roadmap) lists the next steps.
- **Crowd:**
  - Walkers avoid each other along the footway lines, not across open plazas,
    and they don't avoid cars.
  - Bench shade counts buildings and landmarks but not trees.
  - Whether people want sun is a rule of thumb, the month's average top against
    22 °C, not the day's weather.
- **Ferry timetable:** the routes follow the inner-harbour services, but the
  timetable is invented. Ferries run at 1.5 times real speed.
- **Interiors:** buildings are extrusions with no interiors. Roofs are flat,
  except where OpenStreetMap maps building parts.
